To create this blog that you're reading right at this moment I used [Jekyll][jekyll]{:target="\_blank"} and then I used free hosting with [GitHub Pages][github-pages]{:target="\_blank"}.
[Here][tutorial]{:target="\_blank"} is a good YouTube tutorial that I watched to learn how to do it.

My short version of this tutorial:
1. Install [Ruby][ruby]{:target="\_blank"}. Open it up - you will see the terminal. Run everything by choosing options 1, 2, 3.
1. Install Jekyll. Go to your terminal and type:
```console
gem install jekyll bundler
```
1. Create your site. Go to your location and type:
```console
jekyll new blog_name
```
1. Go to newly created directory (*cd blog_name*) and start the page on localhost:
```console
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Your site should open on *localhost:4000*.
1. To add new post. First open VSCode. Under *_posts* you will see *default-jekyll-post*. You can and here your new one. Remember to keep the date structure in the file name (*year-month-day-post-name-here.md*) and also keep the part on the top of the page. This one:
```console
---
layout: post
title:  "Default Jekyll Post"
permalink: "/default-jekyll-post"
---
```
Of course, change the title and permlink. You don't have to have this permlink, but I think it looks better with it.
1. Work on your post. Inside the file use [Markdown][markdown]{:target="\_blank"}.
1. When you finish you want to host your page on Github Pages. YouTube tutorial is [here][host_gh]{:target="\_blank"}. Here is my short version:
- create new repository on GitHub.com, for example *gh_blog*
- then in file *copnfig.yml change variable *baseurl* to *"gh_blog"*
- save all files and then work in terminal with git:

```console
git init
git switch -c gh-pages
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/**USER_NAME**/gh_blog.git
git push origin gh-pages
```
- Next time you change something and want to push your changes you only need this commands:

```console
git add .
git commit -m "Name of your commit"
git push origin gh-pages
```

- If you want to see your changes locally you might need to remove from *copnfig.yml this variable *baseurl* and in terminal just type:

```console
jekyll serve
```
Remember to put this *baseurl* back when you push your changes later.

That's all you need to now to start your journey with GitHub Pages. Good luck!
